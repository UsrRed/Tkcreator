# Tkcreator
IDE for Tkinter

The goal is to help python developers to easily create graphical interfaces with Tkinter.


You therefore have a menu bar with the widgets allowing you to select them to place them on the workplace (gray window).
There is "Configure root" which selects the workplace to configure it.
"Save" and "Open" allow you to save your workplace in a file (you can therefore share interfaces in an editable format).
The "Export" button allows you to create a python file with all the Tkinter widgets that have been placed.

On the right is the configuration window, once a widget has been selected you can select an argument 
to change his value.
There are for some arguments additional modules, for example, for a choice of color, a color selection window appears.

There are shortcuts such as Ctrl + S to save, Ctrl + Z or Backspace to destroy the selected widget or the previous one.
The right click brings up the list of widgets.
